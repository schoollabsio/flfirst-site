# Florida FTC 2024-25 Newsletter #5

_September 21st, 2024_

Greetings Florida FTC Teams, Coaches, Volunteers, and Sponsors:

The Florida FTC season theme this year is Robot Design. Therefore, this newsletter will cover several technical topics including some pointers to videos that can be helpful in robot design. My first design recommendation is to encourage teams to look at game element collectors from the Freight Frenzy and Rover Ruckus seasons. Both of these games included the yellow waffle block game element. The following YouTube video is an example of what you might see: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdaD5qsfuZ8). The other thing that is great about this video is that there are several examples of the team explaining how specific game rules influenced their robot design.

The following are the topics covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1.                      New Florida FIRST Tech Challenge Website (www.flfirst.org)

2.                      AJ’s Tech Corner

3.                      SDK 10.1 Released: Use REV Hardware Client to Update

4.                      Robot Design Ideas

## Newsletter Details

**New Florida FIRST Tech Challenge Website (www.flfirst.org)** – Some of you might have already noticed that a new Florida FIRST Tech Challenge website was release late on Tuesday evening, September 17. Our plan is that we will incrementally add more features and make it easier to use. The first two features that have been included are a new event registration process and a feature for coaches to determine what needs to be updated in the FIRST Dashboard to ensure that your team is “Event Ready”.

Teams can now start registering to attend events within your league by going to the “Event” page on the www.flfirst.org website. The big change is that you will no longer need the 5-digit team code, and you will now create an account using the same email address that you use to login to your FIRST Dashboard. Find your league and the event by scrolling down on the events web page and then select the “Register” button. If the “Register” button is grayed out it means that the registration window for that event is currently not open. You will first be asked to create an account on a system called Region Manager (the following is short video that explains the event registration process: https://youtu.be/AoQfTYcof1Q) .

The second new feature is that you can now validate if your team is “Event Ready”. FIRST requires that each team must have two coaches, both coaches must have signed the online Consent & Release form, and both coaches must have an active YPP background screening. You can determine if your team is event ready by going to the “Teams” page and locating your team number. If you see a “Yes” in the bottom right corner of your team’s information box on the screen, no further action is needed. If you see a “No” you can select the “Coaches get ready now” link to be taken to Region Manager to determine what actions are required to enable your team to be approved by FIRST to attend an event.

A big and loud THANK YOU to [AJ Foster](https://aj-foster.com/) and [Jeremy School](https://jeremy.school) for all of the extra time in the last several months helping re-engineer our website and to Kyle Hoyt for his continued guidance on this journey.

**AJ’s Tech Corner** – AJ’s Tech Corner is now world famous as FIRST has started to promote his videos to help teams. I encourage all Florida FTC teams to visit the following YouTube channel to see the latest tech advance for our Florida lead FTA AJ Foster: https://youtube.com/@ftaaj. AJ has some great videos that include advice on field setup, reviews of some of the robot design ideas seen in Robot in 30 Hours (Ri30H) videos, and a detailed review of the Competition Manual changes.

**DK 10.1 Released: Use REV Hardware Client to Update** – Last week you should have received a FIRST Tech Challenge Team Blast included an announcement that the FTC SDK would be released on September 20, 2024. I encourage teams to update to the latest SDK so that you can test and practice with this software well in advance of your first league meet. The SDK can be updated through the REV Hardware Client when your Driver Hub is connected to your computer. You will just need to press the “Update All” button in the upper right corner of the screen. The final step is to connect to the Robot controller and update the software. The final recommendation is to make sure that you also update your backup devices.

**Robot Design Ideas** – FTC teams are encouraged to learn from other teams and past games. In this newsletter introductory paragraph, I referenced a video from the Freight Frenzy season that can provide some insight to your game element collector design. Another great source of design ideas is the Ri30H videos available on YouTube and some videos from the FTC parts/kit providers. The following are a few additional videos that your team can review for design ideas:

REV Robotics has created a basic robot for the INTO THE DEEP game challenge that can be build from their starter kit: [https://www.revrobotics.com/duo/ftc-starter-bot/?mc_cid=ff0f386b72&mc_eid=2d47985a2d](https://www.revrobotics.com/duo/ftc-starter-bot/?mc_cid=ff0f386b72&mc_eid=2d47985a2d)

Gobilda has also created a starter bot that can be build from their starter kit: [https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-kit-2024-2025-season/?srsltid=AfmBOooTRq70wzGgLff4X3N8koZfo8RSYqzN-C9oG81avIc4XtAwrZ04](https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-kit-2024-2025-season/?srsltid=AfmBOooTRq70wzGgLff4X3N8koZfo8RSYqzN-C9oG81avIc4XtAwrZ04)
