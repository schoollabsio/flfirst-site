## Florida Championship Advancement Criteria

In early December, 2023 we will announce how many teams will advance from each League Tournament to the Florida Championship. The approach we follow is similar to how FIRST determines how many teams advance to the World Championship from each region. All leagues will receive a minimum of 2 advancement slots and the specific number of advancement slots is based on the Relative Size of each league. This means that larger leagues will receive a larger number of advancement slots. Last season, the smallest Florida leagues received 3 team advancement slots and our largest league had 11 advancement slots. Team’s can receive an advancement invitation by winning a Judge award or being a part of a winning robot alliance. Please review chapter 6.0 for the details of the Advancement Criteria.

## About Florida FIRST

The Florida FIRST Tech Challenge season starts in September and runs through February. Student teams develop robots that can perform the tasks defined in the Challenge, then compete with, and against, other teams in their League Meets. The League Meets are relatively local to a group of teams with approximately one scrimmage and two to four meets. This followed by a League Championship usually in the late January time frame. The top teams from each League advance to the State Championship usually held in February. The top teams from state then qualify for the World Championship which is usually held in February.

The purpose of FIRST Tech Challenge is to give high school and middle school age students an opportunity to experience the fun and excitement of complex problem solving in a positive and supportive team environment.

Florida teams have had a long history of success at the highest levels. Florida has 6 World Champions.
