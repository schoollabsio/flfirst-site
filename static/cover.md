## Florida FIRST Tech Challenge

The Florida *[FIRST Tech Challenge™](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/what-is-first-tech-challenge)* program is operated by the Tampa Bay Robotics Foundation and is a sport for engineers. However, FIRST is more than building robots and enables middle and high school students to apply the skills they are learning school in a sports style robotics competition.

*FIRST Tech Challenge™* teams (grades 6-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance/team format. The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of Java-based programming. Participants are eligible to apply for **$80M+** in college scholarships.

The Florida *FIRST Tech Challenge™* program includes **215+** teams from Pensacola to Miami. Florida is organized into [leagues](#leagues) that compete in local events between October and earlier February with some teams qualifying for the Florida Championship in early March.
