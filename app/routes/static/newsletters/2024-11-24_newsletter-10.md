**Dean’s List Student Nominations (Repeat)** – The deadline for submitting Dean’s List nominations is **December 15, 2024**. Coaches can submit nomination essays through the FIRST dashboard. All nominations across Florida leagues will be submitted to a single “Interview Only” event called the “Florida Dean’s List Interview.” Coaches must select this event when submitting nominations.

Each team may submit up to two (2) nominations for 10th or 11th grade team members who best represent FIRST program values. Nominated students will be interviewed during league tournaments to provide input for selecting four (4) Florida Dean’s List Finalists, who will be announced on **March 1, 2025**, at the Florida Championship. These finalists will compete for one of ten (10) Dean’s List Winner titles at the World Championship in April 2025.
