The following are the topics covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1. Dean’s List Student Nominations (Repeat)
2. Key Rule Change Reminder
3. Competition Manual Team Updates

## Newsletter Details

**Dean’s List Student Nominations (Repeat)** – The deadline for submitting Dean’s List nominations is **December 15, 2024**. Coaches can submit nomination essays through their FIRST dashboard. All Florida league nominations will be submitted to a single “Interview Only” event called the “Florida Dean’s List Interview.” Coaches must select this event when submitting nominations.

Each team may submit up to two (2) nominations for 10th or 11th grade team members who best represent FIRST program values. Nominated students will be interviewed during league tournaments to provide input for selecting the four (4) Florida Dean’s List Finalists, who will be announced on **March 1, 2025**, at the Florida Championship. These finalists will compete for one of ten (10) Dean’s List Winner titles at the World Championship in April 2025.

For more details, review Section 6.4.1 Dean’s List Award in the Competition Manual or visit [FIRST Tech Challenge Dean's List](https://www.firstinspires.org).

**Key Rule Change Reminder** – During the Florida FTC Season Kick-off, we highlighted several rule changes for the _INTO THE DEEP℠ presented by RTX_ season. Below are reminders of a few key changes:

- Team Numbers (R401, R402, & R403):

  - Teams no longer need Alliance Markers.
  - Teams must have two red-background and two blue-background team numbers in white.
  - A Microsoft Word template is available for teams with access to a color printer. Email hans.wolf@verizon.net to request the template.

- Servos (R502):

  - Mechanical output power for servos must be less than 8 watts and stall current below 4 amps.
  - A validated servo list is available in the _Inspection Quick Reference_ document on the [FIRST webpage](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/volunteer-resources).

- Horizontal Expansion Rule (R104 & G418):
  - Robots may not expand beyond a 20x42 inch area after the match starts.
  - Violations occur if the robot swings outside the 20-inch limit during Level 2 ASCEND or tips over during a match.

**Competition Manual Team Updates** – FIRST has published six Team Updates, which often include Competition Manual changes. These updates can be found on the [FIRST Game and Season Info page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/game-and-season-info). Below are highlights from recent updates:

- Human Players (G431):

  - Human Players may only place SCORING ELEMENTS in the OBSERVATION ZONE during AUTO and TELEOP periods.
  - Robots and Human Players may not simultaneously control or contact a SCORING ELEMENT.

- Horizontal Expansion (R104 & G418):

  - Horizontal size boundaries must remain coplanar to the TILE floor.
  - Team Update #05 removed the requirement for referees to request a re-inspection for violations.

- Robot Scoring Criteria (ASCEND):
  - Robots may stabilize on the SUBMERSIBLE during ASCEND but must not touch it at match end.
  - Robot chassis may swing into the SUBMERSIBLE ZONE during ASCEND.

**Important Reminder**: Review all Team Updates published by FIRST before attending your next event.
