# Florida FTC 2024-25 Newsletter #13

_January 19th, 2025_

Greetings Florida FTC Teams, Coaches, Volunteers, and Sponsors:

All league meets have been completed, and the next step for each of the eight (8) Florida leagues is to conduct the League Tournament and determine which teams will advance to the Florida Championship. The AeroCoast and Orlando Robotics League Tournaments will be hosted this weekend (January 25th), while the FUN, Gulf Coast, Northeast Florida, ROBOT, South Florida, and Space Coast League Tournaments will take place on February 1st. Teams should begin preparing for judge interviews and planning for the alliance selection process. Please remember that the League Tournament is a much longer day as it includes the alliance selection process, Play-off Matches, and the Awards Ceremony.

Good luck to all teams! I look forward to seeing 56 Florida teams at the Florida Championship on February 28 and March 1 at the AdventHealth Fieldhouse in Winter Haven, FL.

The following are the topics covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1. Florida Championship T-Shirt Design Contest Winner
2. Teams Receiving Bids to the Florida Championship (Repeat)

### Florida Championship T-Shirt Design Contest Winner

The creativity of our Florida FIRST Tech Challenge teams continues to amaze. Selecting the winner of the Florida Championship t-shirt design contest was no easy task, as we received more than 40 fantastic designs. After review by a panel of eight (8) judges, the designs were narrowed down to a short list of four (4). Following significant debate, I am happy to announce that the winner of the t-shirt design contest is Team 27234, the Radical Raiders, from the FIRST United Network (F.U.N.) League. Congratulations to the Radical Raiders!

### Teams Receiving Bids to the Florida Championship (Repeat)

The final activity at your League Tournaments will be the announcement of teams advancing to the Florida Championship on February 28 and March 1, 2025, at the AdventHealth Fieldhouse in Winter Haven, FL.
