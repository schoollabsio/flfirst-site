# Florida FTC 2024-25 Newsletter #7
_October 31st, 2024_

Greetings Florida FTC Teams, Coaches, Volunteers, and Sponsors:

We’ve kicked off the season with our first League Meets! The AeroCoast and North East Florida leagues led the way, completing their first events on October 19th. As we head into a busy schedule with nine League Meets in November and eight in early December, this newsletter provides tips to help coaches and teams prepare for these upcoming events. In December and January, I’ll share more insights on preparing for League Tournaments and the Florida Championship.

The following topics are covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1. Tip: Preparing for League Meets – Inspection
2. Servo and Motor ROBOT Rules
3. Definition of “Event Ready” (Repeat)
4. How to Register to Attend League Events (Repeat)

## Newsletter Details

**Tip: Preparing for League Meets – Inspection** – With the busy INTO THE DEEP season ahead, it’s essential to prepare for Robot and Field inspections. The first step at any League Meet is inspection, so I encourage all teams to review the Competition Manual, especially:
- Section 3.3: MATCH Eligibility Rules
- Chapter 12: ROBOT Construction Rules

**Recommended Best Practices**:
- Self-Inspection: A week before your event, conduct a self-inspection using the Inspection Checklist, which you can find in the "Season Materials" section under "Additional Materials" on the [FIRST webpage](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).
- Use the Self-Inspect Feature: The Driver Station includes a “Self Inspect” feature (accessible from the main menu in the upper right corner). Review the checklist for both the Driver Station and Control Hub, ensuring everything is highlighted green. Any red Xs indicate issues to address before attending an event. Additional self-inspect info can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/FTC-Self-Inspect).

Please verify that your team is using SDK version 10.1.

**Servo and Motor ROBOT Rules** – Chapter 12 of the Competition Manual defines rules for legal motors and servos. **Rule R501** provides a list of allowable motors. Ensure your team’s motors comply with this list, primarily from FTC-approved vendors such as AndyMark, goBILDA, REV Robotics, Studica, and TETRIX.

For servos, **Rule R502** specifies power limits:
- <= 8 watts @6V
- <= 4 amps @6V

Teams can pass inspection by confirming their servos are on the list in Rule R502. If your servos are not listed, you’ll need to verify they meet the power requirements. Use the [servo power calculator on the FTC website](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/tech_tips/tech-tips.html#powercalculator) to confirm compliance.

**Definition of “Event Ready” (Repeat)** – Some coaches have noticed they are unable to register for League Meets due to the “Event Ready” requirement. Being “Event Ready” is mandatory, defined by FIRST, and involves:
1. Completing the FIRST registration process, including the $295 season fee.
2. Registering two coaches for the team through the FIRST Dashboard.
3. Ensuring both coaches sign the FIRST consent and release form.
4. Completing and passing the FIRST YPP screening for both coaches.
5. Ensuring each student team member signs the FIRST consent and release form, ideally through their FIRST Dashboard.

Currently, 10 Florida teams are not “Event Ready.” Coaches can confirm readiness by visiting the [Teams page on the FLFIRST website](http://www.flfirst.org/index.php/season/teams?view=teams). A “0” in the “Ready” column means the team is not ready for registration. Click “Coaches, get ready now” for guidance on completing requirements.

**How to Register to Attend League Meets (Repeat)** – Dates and locations for League Meets and most League Tournaments are now available on the [FLFIRST website](http://www.flfirst.org). To find your event:
- Navigate to the "Events" page: Florida-wide events are at the top, followed by league-specific events organized by date.
- Important Details: Each event listing includes address, registration dates, and the number of registered teams.
- Registration: Coaches #1 and #2 should create an account using the email associated with their FIRST Dashboard login. Scroll to find your league and event, then click “Register.” If the “Register” button is gray, the registration window is not yet open. You will need to create an account on Region Manager.
