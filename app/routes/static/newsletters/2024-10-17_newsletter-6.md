# Florida FTC 2024-25 Newsletter #6

_October 17th, 2024_

Greetings Florida FTC Teams, Coaches, Volunteers, and Sponsors:

It has been a challenging few weeks for many Florida FTC teams impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton. I hope everyone is safe and recovering well. I apologize for the delay in sending out this newsletter, as I was without power and internet due to the storm. (On a lighter note, my daughter’s family found a lost cat after the hurricane and named him Milton!)

The following are the topics covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1. How to Find League Meet Dates/Locations
2. New Florida FIRST Tech Challenge Website (Repeat)
3. SDK 10.1 Released: Use REV Hardware Client to Update
4. Robot Design Ideas
5. Florida Championship T-shirt Design Contest
6. Dean's List Student Nomination

## Newsletter Details

**How to Find League Meet Dates/Locations** – All league event dates and locations are now published on the [Florida FIRST Tech Challenge website](http://www.flfirst.org). To find your league event information, select the "Events" page at the top right of the website. Statewide events are listed at the top, followed by league-specific events. Event details include address, registration window dates, and the number of teams registered. If registration is open, the "Register" button will be blue. Feel free to provide feedback on this new website by replying to this email.

**New Florida FIRST Tech Challenge Website (Repeat)** – A new Florida FIRST Tech Challenge website was launched on September 17. We plan to incrementally add features to enhance usability. Two initial features are:

- **Event Registration**: Teams can register for events without the previous 5-digit team code. Coaches #1 and #2 can use the same email as their FIRST Dashboard login to create an account on Region Manager and register. [Watch this video for more on the registration process](https://youtu.be/AoQfTYcof1Q).
- **Event Readiness Check**: Ensure your team is "Event Ready" by verifying that both coaches have signed the online Consent & Release form and completed the YPP background screening. Check the "Teams" page for your team’s status. A "Yes" in the bottom right indicates readiness, while "No" provides a link to complete requirements.

A big THANK YOU to AJ Foster, Jeremy School, and Kyle Hoyt for their hard work on this project.

**SDK 10.1 Released: Use REV Hardware Client to Update** – The FTC SDK was released on September 20, 2024. Teams should update to SDK 10.1 using the REV Hardware Client. Simply connect your Driver Hub, click "Update All," and then update the Robot Controller software. Remember to update backup devices as well for smooth operation.

**Robot Design Ideas** – Teams are encouraged to explore robot design ideas by reviewing videos from past seasons and other resources. Some recommended videos include:

- **REV Robotics Starter Bot for INTO THE DEEP**: [REV Starter Bot](https://www.revrobotics.com/duo/ftc-starter-bot/?mc_cid=ff0f386b72&mc_eid=2d47985a2d)
- **Gobilda Starter Bot**: [Gobilda Starter Bot](https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-kit-2024-2025-season/?srsltid=AfmBOooTRq70wzGgLff4X3N8koZfo8RSYqzN-C9oG81avIc4XtAwrZ04)

**Florida Championship T-shirt Design Contest** – The volunteer T-shirt contest is back! Submit your design by November 30, 2024, for a chance to receive a guaranteed invitation to the Florida Championship from February 28 to March 1, 2025. Contest requirements:

- Email your design to hanskwolf@gmail.com by midnight on November 30, 2024.
- Submit a high-resolution JPG, single-color logo design.
- Include "Florida Championship 2025" and the INTO THE DEEPSM logo.
  The winner will earn an automatic invitation to the championship, or a $200 credit if they qualify through their league.

**Dean's List Student Nomination** – The deadline for Dean's List nominations is December 15, 2024. Coaches can submit nomination essays through the FIRST Dashboard. Each team may nominate up to two 10th or 11th grade students who embody FIRST program values. Nominees will be interviewed at each league tournament, and four finalists will be announced at the Florida Championship on March 1, 2025. The World Championship in April 2025 will select ten winners from among these finalists. Learn more in [Chapter 10 of the Game Manual Part 1](https://www.firstinspires.org/Robotics/ftc/deans-list).

I encourage all coaches to visit the Dean's List page to learn about last year’s Florida winner, Ramsey McClure.
