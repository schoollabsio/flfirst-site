_November 14, 2024_

Greetings Florida FTC Teams, Coaches, Volunteers, and Sponsors:

The primary purpose of this newsletter is to help you understand the league ranking approach and prepare for several important upcoming deadlines.

The following are the topics covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1. Dean’s List Student Nominations
2. Florida Championship Volunteer T-shirt Design Contest
3. Florida Championship Advancement Criteria
4. Understanding League Ranking

## Newsletter Details

**Dean’s List Student Nominations** – The deadline for submitting Dean’s List nominations is **December 15, 2024**. Coaches can submit nomination essays through the FIRST dashboard. All Florida league nominations will be submitted to a single “Interview Only” event called the “Florida Dean’s List Interview.” Coaches should select this event when submitting Dean’s List nominations.

Each team can submit up to two (2) nominations for students in 10th or 11th grade who best represent FIRST program values. Nominated students will be interviewed during league tournaments to provide input for selecting the four (4) Florida Dean’s List Finalists, announced on March 1, 2025, at the Florida Championship. These finalists will compete for one of ten (10) Dean’s List Winner titles at the World Championship in April 2025.

For more details, review Section 6.4.1 Dean’s List Award in the Competition Manual or visit [FIRST Tech Challenge Dean's List](https://www.firstinspires.org).

**Florida Championship Volunteer T-shirt Design Contest** – The Florida Championship Volunteer T-shirt Design Contest is back! This is your chance to secure a guaranteed invitation to the Florida Championship on **February 28 and March 1, 2025**.

Design submissions are due by **December 20, 2024** and must meet the following requirements:

- Submit the design as a high-resolution JPG file to hans.wolf@verizon.net.
- The file must be single-color.
- Include the text: “Florida Championship 2025.”
- Incorporate the official _INTO THE DEEP℠ presented by Raytheon Technologies_ game logo.

The winner will receive an automatic invitation to the Florida Championship. If the team also qualifies through league advancement, they will receive a $200 credit toward the registration fee.

**Florida Championship Advancement Criteria** – In early December 2024, the number of teams advancing from each League Tournament to the Florida Championship will be announced. This approach mirrors how FIRST allocates advancement slots for the World Championship.

- All leagues will have a minimum of 2 advancement slots.
- Larger leagues will receive more slots based on relative league size.
- Last season, Florida leagues received between 4 and 11 advancement slots.

Advancement is determined by Judge awards or robot alliance performance. Review Chapter 4.0 Advancement in the Competition Manual for details, as there are changes from previous seasons. Notably, there are only two-team alliances in Playoff rounds, with the Winning Alliance Captain and Partner advancing in positions #2 and #3, followed by the 2nd Place Inspire Award team.

**Understanding League Ranking** – Attending as many League Meets as possible helps your team improve its league ranking going into the League Tournament.

League ranking is based on:

- Ranking Score (RS)
- Average Alliance Auto Points
- Average TeleOp Alliance Ascend Points

The scoring software selects a team’s best 10 matches to calculate rankings. For example, if your team participates in 3 League Meets with 6 matches each (18 matches total), the software will use the top 10 matches with the highest scores.

Ranking Score (RS) is the average of a team’s Ranking Points (RP), where:

- Win = 2 RP
- Tie = 1 RP
- Loss = 0 RP

For details, review Section 13.5 Qualification Matches in the Competition Manual.
