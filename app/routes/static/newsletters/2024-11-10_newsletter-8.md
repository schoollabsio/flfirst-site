_November 10, 2024_

Greetings Florida FTC Teams, Coaches, Volunteers, and Sponsors:

We have now completed 8 League Meets but still have 19 more to go. The league season will wrap up with 8 League Tournaments. A reminder to all teams: once you pay your league registration fee, your team can attend all League Meets and participate in your League Tournament. Please review the items below, as I have an important update about this season’s Florida Championship event.

The following are the topics covered in this Florida FTC newsletter:

1. Florida Championship Update
2. League Meet Results Published on FIRST Website
3. Team Number Template Available (Rules R401, R402, & R403)
4. How to Register to Attend League Events (Repeat)

## Newsletter Details

**Florida Championship Update** – The Florida FIRST Tech Challenge Championship will be held on February 28, 2025, and March 1, 2025, at the AdventHealth FieldHouse in Winter Haven, FL. Exciting news this season: we will run 8 qualification matches per team instead of 6. As a result, qualification matches will begin Friday afternoon, and the inspection process will start earlier on Friday.

Volunteers: The Florida Championship event is now in the FIRST Volunteer Management System (VMS), and we will need volunteers available Friday afternoon to start running qualification matches. The current plan is to run 14 matches on Friday.

**League Meet Results Published on FIRST Website** – Teams can access the results of all events within the United States. Event details are available on the FIRST webpage: [https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/2024](https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/2024). To find Florida league event results, select "Florida" from the region menu in the center of the page and press the “Update List” button. Events are organized by date.

**Team Number Template Available (Rules R401, R402, & R403)** – Teams and Coaches, please review the updated team number rules (R401, R402, & R403). Teams are no longer required to use Alliance Markers and must now have two sets of team numbers: two with a red background and two with a blue background. FIRST has published a “Robot Sign Template” on the Season Materials web page, but it requires teams to use red and blue markers to color in their numbers. To assist, I’ve created a Microsoft Word document template that you can use if your team has access to a color printer. Reply to this email if you’d like a copy of the team number template.

**How to Register to Attend League Events (Repeat)** – All League Meet and most League Tournament dates and locations are published on the [www.flfirst.org](http://www.flfirst.org) website. To find your league event information, select the “Events” page near the top-right side of the page. Florida-wide events are listed at the top of the page, followed by events organized by League name and date. Event details include the address, the registration window, and the number of teams registered.

To register, Team Coach #1 and #2 must create an account using the same email address linked to their FIRST Dashboard. Locate your league and event by scrolling down the Events page, then select the “Register” button. If the button is grayed out, the registration window is not yet open. You’ll be prompted to create an account in the Region Manager system. For assistance, watch this short video explaining the event registration process: [https://youtu.be/AoQfTYcof1Q](https://youtu.be/AoQfTYcof1Q).
