However, FIRST is more than building robots and enables middle and high school students to apply the skills they are learning school in a sports style robotics competition.

_FIRST Tech Challenge™_ teams (grades 6-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance/team format. The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of Java-based programming. Participants are eligible to apply for **$80M+** in college scholarships.

The Florida _FIRST Tech Challenge™_ program includes **215+** teams from Pensacola to Miami. Florida is organized into [leagues](/leagues) that compete in local events between October and earlier February with some teams qualifying for the Florida Championship in early March.
